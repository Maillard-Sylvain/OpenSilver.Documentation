# RIA Services

## Status

Good support in OpenSilver

## Notes

We use Open RIA Services, which is the official replacement by Microsoft when RIA Services was discontinued.

- Either use version 5, but there are some API differences compared to the original RIA Services for Silverlight from 2011 
- or use version 4.6 (recommended), but code generation is not functional at this time, you need to copy the generated files from your Silverlight solution (for now)

## NuGet Packages

Coming soon

## Source code

The original documentation for WCF RIA Services is still relevant and can be found at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee707344(v=vs.91).aspx . Namespaces and assembly names are no longer correct since they changed with the release of OpenRiaServices.

Documentation for changes since WCF RIA Services can be found under https://github.com/OpenRIAServices/OpenRiaServices/releases)

Coming soon
