# What is OpenSilver?

OpenSilver is an open-source replacement for Microsoft Silverlight. It is a development tool allowing developers to write web applications using .NET, C #, and XAML, as with Silverlight, with the notable difference that applications created with OpenSilver run on all current browsers, including Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari, without the need to install a plugin.

The OpenSilver project was launched in March 2020 by Userware, a French company specializing in Microsoft development technologies, which has already been working since 2014 on the conversion from C # / XAML to HTML / JavaScript, as part of its other product called CSHTML5.
OpenSilver can be downloaded from [OpenSilver](https://OpenSilver.NET) . The site also contains sample applications and case studies.

The full OpenSilver source code is available on GitHub at [Source Code](https://github.com/OpenSilver)
