OpenSilver addresses the need to maintain Silverlight applications which have sometimes required several years of development. However, the promise of OpenSilver goes far beyond, because it aims to revive the simplicity and the efficiency of the development of rich web applications that Silverlight proposed, by leveraging the Silverlight legacy, modernizing the Silverlight technology through WebAssembly, and pushing the boundaries of what it can do.
