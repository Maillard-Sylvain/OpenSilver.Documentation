Why the need to replace Silverlight?
 ====================

In 2007 Microsoft released Silverlight, a plugin for Internet browsers that revolutionized both the browsing experience for users and the development experience for programmers.

On the user side, Silverlight enabled the display of rich content in web pages, much like the competing Adobe Flash plugin at the time. Thanks to Silverlight, it was possible to have very complex applications that ran entirely inside the browser, with an advanced graphical interface and performance similar to that of native Windows applications.

On the developer side, Silverlight enabled the creation of web applications using .NET, C # and XAML, that is to say very powerful technologies which until then had been reserved for Windows application development.

With the advent and rapid spread of smartphones (iPhone, Android, etc.) and tablets, it has become increasingly difficult to install plugins on Internet browsers. So, little by little, even the Windows versions of the main Internet browsers decided to stop supporting plugins. So that was the end for Adobe Flash and Microsoft Silverlight, which today no longer run on Safari, Chrome, Edge nor Firefox. The last notable version of Silverlight, version 5, was released in December 2011. Then, in 2012, Microsoft announced that Silverlight would only be supported for another ten years, until October 12, 2021, and would only be supported on Microsoft Internet Explorer.

This has been a major problem for many companies that had invested several years of development in their Silverlight applications, particularly in the area of ​​enterprise applications. The need has arisen to find a replacement for Silverlight so as not to throw away all these years of development, hence the birth of OpenSilver.
